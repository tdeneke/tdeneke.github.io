      <description>My interests lie at the intersection between computing and data-intensive applications. I explore ways of efficiently utilizing computing platforms with specialized hardware like GPUs for deep learning, video processing, and big data analytics. Lately, I have been working with several researchers on their computing environment needs, designing, developing, and assisting them on how to efficiently utilize HPC and Cloud platforms with specialized hardware like GPUs. I have also been involved in European projects related to federated machine learning and workflow engines 1 2.</description>
