Hello, I'm Tedy. This is where I save and share things I find interesting.

# What do you do?
I am a researcher at Ã…bo Akademi. I All the code I write is on my
[Github](https://github.com/tdeneke).

# What programming languages do you use?
I started programming with C and C++. Since then I have explored and used many
other programming languages. Mostly I use Python, Matlab and R when exploring
new algorithms, learning mathematical concepts or prototyping services. For
more serious projects I use C, C++ and Java. These days I'm contemplating on
learning some functional programing languages.
